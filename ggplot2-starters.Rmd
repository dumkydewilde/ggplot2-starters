This document is an attempt to set up some basic graph elements for ggplot2 that can be copied and pasted easily when creating new plots and graphs.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
library("RColorBrewer")
library("stringr")
library("tidyr")
library("dplyr")
library("knitr")

#Knitr options
opts_chunk$set(comment=NA, fig.width=8, fig.height=6,
               fig.path='figures/', warning=FALSE)
```

Let's start with the basics:

```{r 001_plot }

p <- ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Cars: speed and distance")

p #And plot it
```

##Background and axes
Now let's make it a little nicer and set up the background and axes

```{r 002_background}

bg_and_axes <-  theme(
  panel.background = element_rect(fill = NA),
  panel.grid.major.y = element_line(colour = "#cccccc", size = 0.3, linetype = "dotted"),
  panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
  axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
  axis.line.x = element_line(color = "black", size = 0.5),
  axis.text = element_text(colour = "#666666"),
  axis.title = element_text(colour = "#999999", face = "italic"),
  axis.text.x = element_text(margin = margin(16,0,12,0)),
  axis.text.y = element_text(margin = margin(0,16,0,12)),
  plot.title = element_text(family = "Avenir", size = rel(2), 
                            margin = margin(0,6,24,6), hjust = 0),
  plot.margin = unit(c(1,1,1,1), "cm"))

p + bg_and_axes
```

##Scales
Set the scales properly:

```{r 003_scales}
p2 <- p + bg_and_axes + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,125), breaks = seq(0,125,25), expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,27), breaks = seq(0,25,5), expand = c(0,0))

p2 #And plot our new graph
```

##Bars and colors
Now to some bar charts and colors. I like the spectral color set because it is easy to tell the colors apart, and works for the color blind too, but it still has the feeling of matching colors.

```{r 004_bars_and_colors}
p3 <- ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(color, ..count.., fill=cut)) +
  geom_bar() +
  bg_and_axes +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,12000), expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0,0)) +
  ggtitle("Diamonds by cut and color")

legend_opts <- theme(
  legend.text = element_text(color = "#666666"),
  legend.title = element_text(color = "#666666", face = "italic"),
  legend.direction = "vertical",
  legend.position = c(0.9,0.9),
  legend.key.size = unit(12, "pt")
  )

p3 +
  legend_opts +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Spectral", direction = -1)
```

Now let's go from stacked bars to non-stacked, and flip 'm over, because I always favor horizontal bars instead of vertical. It makes for easier comparison, especially for longer lists, and improves readability of the label text. Let's take a different data set and you'll see what I mean. We'll also use a trick to wrap the text of the labels, which can be convenient if you're labels are the questions from a questionnaire for example.

```{r 005_horizontal_bars, fig.height=7}
#Make sure we have some long label names so you'll see how they wrap.
msleep["full_name"] <- paste(msleep$name, paste(", also known as: ", 
                             msleep$genus, msleep$order), sep = "")

#now for the plot.
p4 <- ggplot(msleep[msleep$order == "Primates",], aes(reorder(full_name, sleep_total), sleep_total)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill=brewer.pal(3, "Set1")[1]) +
  #Our (stringr) trick for wrapping long labels on horizontal bar charts
  scale_x_discrete(labels = function(x) str_wrap(x, width = 25)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Sleep times of primates")

p4 +
  bg_and_axes +
  theme(
    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(colour = "#cccccc", size = 0.3, linetype = "dotted"),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank())
```

Next up is one of my favorite plots, the heatmap. A heatmap can be a great way to spot patterns in your data. It's usually the count, mean, or density of two categorical variables. I like plotting labels on the tiles of the heatmap because it can give the viewer a better understanding of the scope we're dealing with. A contrast in color helps to spot patterns, but it can mean a variety of things, which is why you often need to give some more context.

```{r 006_heatmap}
#We'll use the standard R data set with Hair and Eye Color of Statistics Students.
haireye <- as.data.frame(HairEyeColor)

#The data is ordered by hair color, eye color and sex, so we'll use summarise and groupby from the dplyr package to sum the frequencies for male and female.

p5 <- ggplot(summarise(group_by(haireye, Hair, Eye), Freq=sum(Freq)), 
       aes(x=Hair, y=Eye, fill=Freq)) +
  geom_tile() +
  geom_text(aes(label=sprintf("%1.2f%%",Freq/sum(Freq)*100)), colour = "white") +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Greens", direction = 1) +
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0,0)) +
  ggtitle("Hair and Eye Color of Statistics Students")
 
p5_options <- bg_and_axes +
  theme(
    legend.position = 0,
    axis.line.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
  )

p5 + 
  p5_options
```

In the case above we've combined the frequencies for male and female, but because heatmaps are such a great way to show patterns, we can also easily compare the two visually.

```{r 007_heatmap_male_female}

p6 <- ggplot(haireye, aes(x=Hair, y=Eye, fill=Freq)) +
  geom_tile() +
  geom_text(aes(label=sprintf("%1.2f%%",Freq/sum(Freq)*100)), colour = "white") +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Greens", direction = 1) +
  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0,0)) +
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0,0)) +
  ggtitle("Hair and Eye Color of Statistics Students") +
  facet_wrap(~Sex)

facet_options <- theme(
  strip.background = element_blank(),
  strip.text = element_text(face = "bold")
)

p6 +
  p5_options +
  facet_options

```
